Training Neural Networks with C++ - LinkedIn Learning
 - 25/07/2022
 - Neural Network ~ learning/calssifying
 - Why C++?
  - Most widely used and popular programming languages
  - plethora of libraries (including neural nets)
  - Run code anywhere because of STL
  - akinator and 20q.net
Learning Methods
 - Supervised Learning
    - Regression - Linear, Logistic, Exponential - stock markets and weather predictors
    - Classification -  Suppoert vector machines, decision trees

 - Unsupervised Learning 
  - Clustering - medical imaging, recommender 
  - Anomaly detection
  - Neural Networks - deep belief Networks

- Reinforcement Learning - feedback loop with reqrds/penalties based on behaviour (think of the rat experiments)
 - Video game AI's


- Hopfield Neural Networks


 
- Convolutional Neural Networks
 - Feed forward/multilayered perceptrons
